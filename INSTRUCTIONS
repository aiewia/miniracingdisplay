# Sim Racing OLED Dash – Setup Guide

🚧 Work In Progress  
This guide explains how to wire and use the Arduino OLED Dash firmware.

---

## Overview

This project uses:

- Arduino-compatible board
- 128x64 SH1106 OLED display (SPI)
- SimHub for telemetry output

The firmware receives telemetry data from SimHub via Serial and displays:

- Gear
- RPM bar
- RB-style shift logic
- DRS indicator
- Pit limiter screen

# Hardware Wiring

## OLED Display (SH1106 SPI)

This project uses a 4-wire SPI OLED.

### Pin Connections

| OLED Pin | Arduino Pin |
|----------|-------------|
| VCC      | 5V (or 3.3V if required) |
| GND      | GND |
| CLK      | 13 (SCK) |
| MOSI     | 11 (MOSI) |
| CS       | 10 |
| DC       | 9 |
| RES      | 8 |

⚠️ If your OLED is 3.3V only, do NOT use 5V.

# Software Setup

## 1. Install Arduino IDE

Download from:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

---

## 2. Install Required Library

In Arduino IDE:

Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries  
Search for:

U8g2

Install:
**U8g2 by oliver**

---

## 3. Upload Firmware

1. Open the `.ino` file.
2. Select your board:
   Tools → Board
3. Select correct COM port.
4. Click Upload.

# SimHub Setup

## 1. Install SimHub

Download:
https://www.simhubdash.com/

---

## 2. Create Custom Serial Device

In SimHub:

1. Go to **Arduino**
2. Add a new **Custom Serial Device**
3. Select correct COM port
4. Set baud rate to:

115200

---

## 3. Paste the JavaScript Code

Paste the provided telemetry script into:

Custom Protocol → JavaScript

Make sure the output format matches:

GEAR: RPM: MAX: DRS: PIT:

---

# Modes

## Standard Mode
- Proportional RPM bar
- Uses simulator MaxRPM

## RB Mode
- Half bar at 10,000 RPM
- Full bar at 11,600 RPM
- Flash above 12,200 RPM

---

# Supported Sims

- F1 Series (UDP)
- Assetto Corsa
- Other SimHub-compatible titles

---

# Troubleshooting

### Nothing appears on screen
- Check wiring
- Confirm correct COM port
- Confirm baud rate = 115200
- Ensure SimHub is running

### RPM bar fills too fast
- Verify MaxRPM is being received from SimHub

### Display flickers
- Ensure proper power supply
- Avoid long unshielded wires
